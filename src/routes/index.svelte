  <h1>👋 Hello friend 👋</h1>
  <p>🇫🇷 French and german 🇩🇪 developer here ! 🤖</p>
  <p>
    🎓I did a Higher National Diploma in International Business in sandwich
    courses.
  </p>
  <p>
    💡I could develop competences like customer relationship, project management
    and team bulding
  </p>
  <p>
    💻 I wanted to increase my competences so I followed an intensive training
    to be a fullstack javascript web developer.
    <br />
    🎓 I challenged myself to learn to develop and I'm now diplomed of a
    Associate Degree in Software Development.
  </p>
  <p>
    ⌨️ Now I apply those competences in an agile work environment based on open
    communication, kindness, learning to perform.
  </p>
  <p>
    🗝 I currently learn a lot by myself about computer science and related
    topics especially cybersecurity.
